Each button has a specific purpose:

- The Standard Button is only to be used on the Call to Action banner.

- An alternative is the Dark Button, which is to be used when the background is busy or when the yellow does not appear properly.

- The Ghost Button should be the most used button. It is for sections, forms; anywhere where the background is completely white.

It is okay to change the 'font-size' class of the buttons to make them different sizes.
