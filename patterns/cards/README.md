Cards are used to differentiate blocks of text.

- The Icon Card is to explain different aspects of the company or products. For example, they are to be used to describe the core company values. The text should always be accompanied by an icon as a visual aid.

- The Item Card is to present the different products. Anytime a product is displayed, it should be in this card. They can be used anywhere that is appropriate.

- The Sale Card is to be used on items that are on sale that are not on the Sale Page specifically. For example, it can be used to showcase sale items on the front page.

- The Shop Card is simply a large button used to direct the user to specific product sections. The image used must represent the product itself.
